# Quantum-Secure Blockchain Logging

This repository contains the source code and prototype implementation for the paper:

**"Quantum-Backed Integrity for Industrial Blockchain Events: A Secure Logging Framework Using Qiskit and Ethereum"**  
📅 Submitted to: [QIS Conference 2025](https://conference-questis.org/)  
👤 Author: Benoît Prieur, Medialoco LLC

## 🧠 Project Overview

This proof-of-concept demonstrates a secure logging pipeline where each recorded event:
- is seeded with quantum-generated entropy using **IBM Qiskit**,
- is hashed with **SHA-256** for tamper detection,
- and is immutably stored via a **Solidity smart contract** on a local **Ethereum blockchain** powered by **Hardhat**.

The aim is to enhance data authenticity and traceability in industrial systems by fusing quantum physics and blockchain technologies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) – for quantum random number generation (QRNG)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) – for blockchain interaction
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) – for smart contract development and local Ethereum simulation
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) – for smart contract implementation
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) – for quantum circuit execution and entropy export

## ⚙️ Local Setup & Usage

Make sure you have both **Python 3** and **Node.js** installed.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Medialoco/quantum-secure-blockchain.git
cd quantum-secure-blockchain
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Python (QRNG)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Node.js / Hardhat
npm install
```

### 3. Start the local blockchain node (Terminal 1)

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Leave this terminal open — it runs the local Ethereum blockchain.

### 4. Run the event logging script (Terminal 2)

In a second terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/setQuantum.js --network localhost
```

This will:
- Run a Qiskit quantum circuit to generate a random number,
- Construct a SHA-256 hash of the event (quantum value + metadata + timestamp),
- Store the event via a smart contract on the local chain,
- Retrieve and print the event for verification,
- Save the result to `quantum_event.json`.
